# propositions

List of putative PhD propositions:

* "Life, Uh, Finds a Way" --- Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), Jurassic Park (Steven Spielberg, 1993)
* Models are extended intuitions
* A big part of the job of a scientist is to say when they don't know (and so, science is not "just" another belief system)
* "Keep an open mind â€“ but not so open that your brain falls out" (attributed to Walter Kotschnig)
* The theory of evolution still lacks the predictive power that a good theory, in theory, should have.
