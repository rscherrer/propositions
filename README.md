# propositions

List of putative PhD propositions:

* "Life, Uh, Finds a Way" --- Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), Jurassic Park (Steven Spielberg, 1993)
* Models are extended intuitions
* A big part of the job of a scientist is to say when they don't know (in that, science is different from other belief systems)
* "Keep an open mind â€“ but not so open that your brain falls out" (attributed to Walter Kotschnig)
* The theory of evolution still lacks the predictive power that a good theory, in theory, should have. Not that it invalidates it, it's just that the nut hasn't been fully cracked yet.
* There are two ends on the modeling spectrum in ecology and evolution: on the one end, models that tell us what is plausible, and on the other, models that tell us what is likely.
