List of putative PhD propositions:

* Don't believe everything you see on the Internet (Abraham Lincoln)
* A model should be as simple as possible but not simpler (Einstein?)
* Just because something is complicated does not mean it is complex (Sander)
* With great computational power comes great transparency and bookkeeping responsibility
* Honest controversy is the fuel for improvement. Etienne Pierrot at Medium (2022) https://medium.com/checkout-com-techblog/scientific-methodology-test-driven-development-2570250dc1ae
* Playing with LaTeX, R or C++ is time better spent than writing an introduction (R.S.Etienne 2025)
* More research is needed.
* One of the most statisfying things in life is to write the Methods section of a paper.
* Knowing science does not protect against falling for pseudo-science. Steven Novella, SGU #1046, 2025

* "Keep an open mind – but not so open that your brain falls out" (attributed to Walter Kotschnig)
* The theory of evolution still lacks the predictive power that a good theory, in theory, should have. Not that it invalidates it, it's just that the nut hasn't been fully cracked yet.
* There are two ends on the modeling spectrum in ecology and evolution: on the one end, models that tell us what is plausible, and on the other, models that tell us what is likely.
* "Perfect is the enemy of the good." Voltaire
* Making a model is easy, making a model that teaches you something you did not already know is a whole different beast.
* Showing that a model with some properties produces a certain pattern is not the same as showing that the properties cause the pattern.
* Some things are just not worth modeling. G. S. van Doorn
* Making a model is not about testing facts, it is about testing our own intuition
* Complex systems are doomed to be using simple math. Simple systems, in contrast, have the luxury of being able to use complicated math.
* It's crazy how throughout history it's always the good guys who win. Mark van Zomeren, 2024
* Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. Marie Curie 
* Deadlines aren't made to be respected. Amandine 2024
* "'But all them things exist,' said Nanny Ogg. 'That's no call go to around believing in them. It only encourages 'em.' Granny Weatherwax, in Terry Pratchett's Lords and Ladies

* You know what scientist say a lot? "I don't know" - Stephen Fry
* I am against religion because it teaches us to be satisfied with not understanding the world. Richard Dawkins (check)
